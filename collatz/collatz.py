    For a given starting number, determine how many iterations of `next_value`
    it takes to reach 1.

    For example, since next_value(2) == 1

    A single call to next_value, so stopping_time(2, 100) == 1

    But next_value(3) == 10,
        so we call next_value(10) which is 5
        so we call next_value(5) which is 16
        so we call next_value(16) which is 8
        so we call next_value(8) which is 4
        so we call next_value(4) which is 2
        so we call next_value(2) which is 1

    A total of 7 calls to next_value, so stopping_time(3, 100) == 7

    Since the Collatz conjecture is unproven, we don't know that this function
    will terminate. Therefore, the function should quit if it reaches
    max_iterations.

    Input:
        n(int): An initial value, guaranteed to be >= 1.
        max_iterations(int): A maximum number of iterations to try.

    Output:
        The number of iterations it took to reach 1.
        Will return max_iterations if 1 was not reached.
